review_text
"""Started taking this medication off label for weight loss only. I am not diabetic. Started on Aug 30, 2020. First 2 weeks I had some mild nausea, nothing terrible, and some mild dizziness. The past 2 weeks, I have had no symptoms. I definitely cannot eat what I used to, or you will feel sick. I am doing the weekly injection at 0.25 along with Weight Watchers, and in the past 26 days, I have lost 10.5 lbs :). My sweet tooth cravings are pretty much gone. Really happy so far. I am increasing to 0.50mg next week. I'll keep you all posted!"""
"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""I was hesitant to try Ozempic for weight loss (need to lose 30 lbs) because I have a lot of kids/responsibilities and don't have the time to be nauseous or have debilitating diarrhea, etc. After keeping the pen in the fridge for weeks, I decided to risk an injection, and I'm so happy to say I've had zero side effects except a disinterest in food. I'm on week six of the 0.25 dose because it's enough for me, and I don't see a reason to increase the dose. My lack of interest in food is liberating! For the first time in 30 years, I don't go to bed kicking myself for what I've eaten or making promises to myself to make amends for overeating. Zero sugar cravings...food isn't a reward or pleasure anymore. I'm never ravenous, so I make good, calm choices about what I eat. This has been life-changing and a complete shift in perspective. Obviously, some people have terrible side effects, but I've had none (not even a headache!)."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I started Ozempic 9 months ago. At the time, I was a little over 200 lbs and was taking 1000 mg of metformin daily. Metformin had worked for me for almost 20 years, so I didn't expect that it had suddenly stopped working. For 3 years, I gained weight even though I worked out, and I thought it was just my appetite out of control. One random day, I realized my metformin was the problem. I saw a new doctor who prescribed Ozempic. What a miracle! 9 months later, and I���������m down 40 lbs, my A1C dropped from 8.1 to 5.6, and I have virtually no symptoms from the drug other than fullness. The symptoms in the beginning did not last long either. Nausea, headache, fatigue...all cleared up within a week or 2 each time my dose was increased. It can cause what feels like constipation, but for me, it���������s just that I simply haven���������t eaten enough. This drug feels too good to be true. I���������m so pleased wi"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I did one injection and have been ill since. I have had acid reflux, burping, vomiting, constipation, headache, and dizziness. I tried to eat small meals and drink plenty of water as directed by my physician, but I have been unable to hold anything down. Five days after my first injection, I'm off work, drinking Pedialyte, trying to get my strength back, and avoid being hospitalized. This is the worst that I have ever felt in my life."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I���������ve been on Ozempic for 4 weeks. I am so glad that my doctor sat me down and told me what to expect. She also asked if I could handle it. She said that if you can make it through the 4th week, I promise it will get better. She was right. I was pretty sick the first two weeks. I learned that it had a lot to do with me trying to eat my normal intake of food. Once I started to catch a clue and make my portions smaller, I learned it would make me feel better. I could guarantee if I ate too much, I���������d feel like crap. People aren���������t kidding about the side effects. It���������s real. But I made it and am now starting to feel better with each day. I���������ve lost 18 pounds now and I���������m amazed. Yes, it makes you sick, but if you keep trying to eat like you did, it will be worse. You have to start listening to your body. You can���������t keep eating yo"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Started on Ozempic in September 2020, starting weight 312 lbs (5���������4���������). I am type 2 diabetic and take 2550mg of Metformin daily. HbA1c was 79, sugar cravings, and blood sugar out of control. Started on 0.25 dose for a month. Quite bad stomach cramps and nausea for the first month. Went up to 0.5 dose in month 2, then 1.0 dose for month 3 and since. No. 1 tip - inject into your leg rather than around your belly. Once I changed to injecting in my leg, nausea and cramps disappeared overnight, and never came back. To maximize effectiveness, you can���������t eat like you did before. I re-joined Weight Watchers in September. I have lost 80 lbs in 5 months, HbA1c dropped from 79 to 51 which is a normal type 2 level although the doc feels with more weight loss, it could go to normal levels. In Ireland, diabetes is classed as a long-term illness so all medications are covered by the government, so I don���������t have to pay for this. Oth"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I took one Ozempic injection at 0.25 and ended up at the ER 2 days later. I had horrible bloating. Burping smelled like eggs. Unstoppable vomiting and diarrhea. I ONLY TOOK ONE INJECTION and stopped the medicine. It has been 2 weeks and the medicine is still making me sick. I'm just wondering how long it takes to fully leave your system? I just want to feel human again. I was tested for pancreatitis but was okay, but the doctor said they will repeat labs soon. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION TO ANYONE. PLEASE BE SAFE TAKING THIS MEDICATION."""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""I have been on Ozempic for exactly 1 year as my insulin intake (injection) was far too high, as well as Metformin. I was asked if I wanted to try Ozempic and was told that it may help with weight loss too. In the course of the year, I have lost over 9 stone in weight and gone from a ladies size 26 in clothing to a size 14 to 16. I have never been happier with my weight, my blood sugars are normal levels now which they were previously out of control."""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""I was prescribed it for prediabetes and weight loss. Today, in one week since my first injection, I lost 6 lbs. In one week, the last diet (one of very many), it took me 3 months to lose 10 lbs by starving myself, which tells you how elevated sugar prevents you from losing weight. I am not diabetic, my A1C is 5.5. I had slight nausea and fatigue the first 2 days, and after that, it���������s all gone and I never felt better. I have no cravings. I eat approximately 1000 calories a day, and it���������s more than enough. Instead of constant thoughts of food, I do other things that I used to enjoy like exercise, etc. I am worried about coming off Ozempic before I lose all the weight I need. It is a miracle drug for me! I hope it will help you all! If they keep working on meds like this, it will reduce type 2 diabetes and obesity """
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Ozempic has caused me so much constipation!!! I know a side effect is diarrhea, but it does the complete OPPOSITE for me. A day or two after I take my injection, I have no bowel movements at all!! Every week I am forced to take a laxative. It has caused so many problems for me. Anyone else experienced severe constipation. So frustrated."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I'm a 54-year-old female whose A1C was 8.3 at the end of March. So, after 4 months on Ozempic, my A1C is now 6.3, and I've lost 34 lbs. Definitely curbs my appetite, and I have been logging my food. My side effects have been minimal - a little nausea in the beginning and constipation. This med has been a game-changer for me. My hope is that many others will have the same results I have."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""After reading this, that junk in the fridge will go in the garbage. 
Do NOT  put yourselves through this for weight loss and even diabetes.
I mean seriously, which is worse?
Pancreatitis? Thyroid cancer? Horrible gastro conditions? 
Injecting ourselves with this lizard juice can't be good for us.
And, it���������s beyond expensive to say the least.
Pharmaceutical companies should be ashamed of themselves but that���������s nothing new. 
This is totally off the charts.
Just say no to drugs these drugs.
Please be fair and unbiased and publish this comment, if you���������re """
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I was terrified to take this after reading some of the reviews online, but I have to say I am so happy I started this drug. I've followed others' suggestions about injecting the drug into my upper thigh and not my abdomen. I was on a 0.25 dose for 4 weeks, then moved to 0.5, and that's what I currently take. My appetite has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY. I was addicted to eating junk foods, and I simply cannot eat them anymore, my stomach cannot handle them. I get full after eating one properly sized meal, and it keeps me going for most of the day, only having a snack like 1 apple in the evening. Side effects were mild for me, I had some constipation, but I started taking fiber supplements to help with that. I have been on the medication for 7 weeks now, and I'm down 10 lbs, and I feel great. Make sure your doctor gets you to increase the dose slowly, inject into your thigh, and be ready to make better dietary choices when starting this drug. I truly believe it saved me from morbid obesity."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I started Ozempic in late December at 0.25 injection. I also take 500mg metformin per day. Soon after I started Ozempic, I had decreased appetite and my sugars improved, but I had reflux, gas, bloating, nausea, and diarrhea. After 4 weeks, I started 0.50. 2 weeks in, I have bouts of painful constipation then diarrhea, nausea, bloating, gas, reflux, and cramping. I've almost vomited a few times. When I eat, it feels like the food just sits and sits, barely moving through my gut. My doctor wants me to stick with it, saying that these side effects usually improve, but it's been pretty miserable. I'm thinking I'm going to stop taking it. While Ozempic has been effective in regulating my sugars and losing weight, I don't think it's worth the suffering that I've been enduring on this medication. I understand that studies showed it causing thyroid cancer in mice, but no one knows if it causes thyroid cancer in humans. I don't want to be the guinea pig the drug makers use to find out it does."""
"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""I started Ozempic on 2/22/23 weighing 216 lbs. As of today, 4/1/2023, I am 191.2 lbs, so just about 25 lbs in 5.5 weeks! I started out at 0.25 for 4 weeks, then moved to 0.5 last week. I've been nauseous maybe 4 times, I���������ve gotten a few headaches, and kinda backed up about 3 days a week. I started taking magnesium at night before bed, and that really helped me get more regular. I���������m barely hungry and need to force myself to eat. Anyways, I���������m really excited and I���������m lo"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Been on Ozempic since mid-April 2020. All side effects listed with the worst being chronic diarrhea. Nausea has been significant but has settled to occasionally. Trying to follow a more plant-based diet, I have lost today an official 60 pounds. I find the less meat I eat, the more energy I have, the better my blood sugars are as well. I am 53, so weight loss isn't impossible for us older ladies..."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I have been on 0.5 Ozempic for 2 months now. The nausea is no better. I vomit almost every day. Driving down the road and I begin to vomit. Almost caused me to wreck my car twice now. I've lost 30 pounds and feel terrible. My stomach hurts all the time and now my back. I do not urinate much at all even though I've increased water. Calling today and going off it. Losing weight is great, but not at the cost of feeling horrible every day."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I have been taking Ozempic for 16 months and have lost 80 lbs! I started at 0.25 and have moved up to 1. At first, I was terribly sick, but I took my time to adjust bit by bit while the dose was slowly raised, and now I don't feel sick at all from it. If you can hold on and push through (the push was hard, REALLY sick some days), it does get better. It has saved my life."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I was put on Ozempic after taking Glimepiride for several years. I started on 0.25mg, then onto 1mg. I started having the nastiest burps ever, then diarrhea 3 to 4 times a day. After 3 months, I went to a gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with gastroparesis, a side effect of Ozempic. I have all the side effects - nasty, offensive-smelling burps, eye floaters in both eyes, bad diarrhea, stomach pain, and now this disease that has caused precancerous cells. Yes, my appetite has decreased, I have lost 15 lbs in 3 months, and my numbers are good. But it's not worth being sick every day. I just found out my daughter is going through the same exact thing. So, take it at your own risk."""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""I did lots of research before starting Ozempic, so was aware of potential (hideous) side effects. I started a week ago on a starting dose of 0.25. (Had my second 0.25 dose this morning). Super, super, super happy! Based on research, I have opted to inject in my upper leg rather than my tummy. I don���������t know if it���������s based on the injection location, or if I���������m just lucky, but I have had ZERO side effects. No nausea, no dizziness, nothing. I am eating three sensible, small, low-fat meals a day, with perhaps a small amount of fruit as a snack, and walk my dog regularly. I am down 1 kg (2.2 pounds) over the week, and am super confident that I will be able to continue on Ozempic until I get down to my goal weight (20 kg/44 pounds to go). Although my doctor said he will increase my Ozempic to 0.5 then 1mg over the next 2 months, I am going to say no and stay on 0.25 for as long as that works for me. Why increase if the current dose is working! I am 55. Cost in Australia """
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Did the first 4 weeks of Ozempic at 0.25 had mild stomach issues. Nausea was come and go, really not consistent. Helped control my eating. Doctor said if you overeat or eat like you used to, you will throw up. There is no place for overeating but up. Didn't overeat, didn't have much issue. Took stool softener to keep things moving. At the 0.5 dose, ate less but had fewer side effects than my first dose. Glad I have started the med, it works."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I have been taking Ozempic for 4 months to reduce insulin resistance (caused by polycystic ovary syndrome). The medication has significantly reduced my appetite. I have had a few minor side effects - a stomach cramp here, an episode of diarrhea there...but nothing at all significant. My weight went from 151 (BMI 25.9) to 133 three months later (BMI 22.8). I honestly could not be happier."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I started taking Ozempic in June 2020, initially lost 20 pounds by August. Total of 30 pounds so far, last 10 have been a lot slower. I went from 186 pounds to 156 pounds. A1c went from 6.5 to 5.6. Minimal side effects include occasional nausea and constipation. Started using Miralax, which has helped. Side effects I have experienced are worth the benefits. I consistently wake up with glucose levels in 80-90 range, never out of the green zone on a glucometer. I cannot overeat. If I do, I feel ill or get heartburn, so I have learned my lesson. I am really happy with this medication."""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""Having struggled with a need for carbs and sugar for over 2 decades, it caught up with. Constantly sluggish, despite regular exercise. Risk of heart issues as I have an inherited Cholesterol disease. Weight, well that's a given, most females postmenopausal struggle to lose weight. So, after all sorts of natural therapies and a ton of exercise, nothing helped very much. My GP mentioned Ozempic, even though I was only pre-diabetic she still felt it would help. After the usual low-dose start - 6 weeks later up to 1mg. I have been injecting weekly and 6 months later, I am not only 30 lbs down, I feel so brilliant. More energy, better sleep, and no sugar cravings at all. It has been great. No side effects, maybe a little constipation at the start (mainly due to a change in eating habits). Superb med, wish more people could be offered the chance to use it. It is still expensive in the insurance world, however, hopefully like many other meds in this country, the costs will lessen."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I took one dose of Ozempic and I have been sick ever since. Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, and a little dizziness. This is terrible, will never use again. Can someone tell me how long these symptoms last?"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Side effects are mild for me, but it really decreases your appetite. Initially, I could only tolerate fresh fruits and vegetables. I took this as an opportunity to change my lifestyle. I eat healthier and avoided sugary drinks. I lost a total of 40 lbs. in 6 months. A1C dropped from 7.3 to 5.4. Dress size dropped from 14 to size 4. I am no longer on daily insulin, BP meds, and cholesterol meds. All labs are normal. This medication is my lifesaver."""
"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""Since my first injection, I have felt utterly dreadful. The nausea is one thing, but I have constant fatigue that prevents me from leading my normal life. I know it suppresses appetite, but I don���������t have ANY appetite at all and cannot face food. I know if I eat, I will feel a bit better, but it���������s impossible. I actually feel like I���������ve been drugged. Yes, the ���������food noise��������� has gone, and I no longer overeat or binge, but I feel like everything is suppressed - like I���������m on a strong drug. I did 4 weeks at 0.25 and have just done one week at 0.5, but I can���������t do this anymore. I feel utterly dreadful. I am so pleased it���������s helping so many people, but more research is neede"""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""I went on Ozempic for weight loss after being told by a friend of mine about it - she started at 280 lbs and lost 60+ pounds. My whole life I���������ve always been about 130 pounds, and then I rapidly gained 50 pounds within about 2 years. I started taking Ozempic at 182 pounds (I���������m 5���������4) and 6 months later I am down 25 pounds and continuing to lose. I could not recommend this drug more. It INTENSELY reduced my appetite and obsession over food. Aside from some occasional nausea (maybe once every 2 weeks), and some diarrhea, nothing that I can���������t handle, the drug has been pretty great. This is on"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I've been on Ozempic for 8 weeks. At first, I had side effects of a lot of nausea. Now, I wake up cold and clammy the last week and very anxious. Overall feeling unwell. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this?"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I suffered from - Loss of appetite - Exhaustion - Nausea - Vomiting (once a week, usually 2 days after my injection) - Low blood sugar events (probably caused because I just had no appetite). When I spoke to my pharmacist, she encouraged me to try to hang in there, telling me it would get better, and it finally has. I was not expecting it to take over 3 months though. My readings are all good, and I've lost 28 lbs, so there were benefits to sticking it out, but it was hard. I had decided that I would continue to take the medication until my next appointment, and if things were still bad, I would tell the doctor that I no longer wanted to use it. Things are better, and my appointment is next week."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Honestly, I am so impressed so far with these meds. My weight had been creeping up due to insulin resistance (which itself makes it harder to lose weight) and PCOS. My doctor recommended I try this in conjunction with a very low carb and calorie diet. I started with a half dose of 0.25mg once a week injection and then after 2 weeks up to 0.5mg a week. So far in 6 weeks, I���������ve lost 15cm from my waist and 9cm off my hips, and 5cm off my bust. I have been eating light and easy, roughly 1000 calories a day. Haven���������t weighed myself yet as I���������d prefer to see the difference in cm. This medication makes me feel a little nauseous the first day or two after my shot, but after that, I never feel hungry. I can quite easily eat a super small portion and feel full! I drink about 2L of water a day and do about 8000 steps at my job. It really has been great and so much cheaper than Saxenda, which was another one I was considering. Hopefully, I contin"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Listen to me, Ozempic will change your life, but you cannot eat synthetic sugar at all. I had severe Hashimoto's, PCOS, insulin resistance, and severe diabetes symptoms. HbA1c was high, all cholesterols were high despite the healthiest of diets. My numbers cleared from severe to perfect in 1 month! I had full-body swelling, severely cracked ankles, swollen feet, neck, legs, major hair loss... a nightmare. I began taking Ozempic. I was very sick. It made me extremely nauseous. I got severe diarrhea, but let me tell you, I lost 17 pounds of water weight in one month. My doctor couldn���������t believe it. In four months, I lost 40 lbs. The nausea was mild to severe the entire time, but the results were borderline insane. It reset my metabolism, took all of the inflammation away from my joints, neck, back, my feet completely healed within one month. It���������s barely believable. I spent two months on 0.25 and increased to 0.5 once a week for ten more months. """
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I've been on it for 7 weeks. I have had the runs as others have noted, and the sour stomach, but what I also noted is that those symptoms are worse if you've eaten too much or a heavier meal before bedtime. Small snacks are ok. I don't drink any sugar-laden beverages, and I eat lots of fiber already. My diet is mostly vegetarian, but not for any reason other than my stomach just feels better on it. I think that has helped keep the side effects in check. So far, I've lost 8 lbs, which TBH is kind of shocking. I never thought my body would give up this weight, but I'm heading in the right direction. Sugars are dropping nicely, especially my fasting sugar. I have that hypo drop and spike when you wake up, and that seems to be leveling off, which is great. So I'm going to keep going. Oh, and I didn't jump in with dosing, I started with 0.25 and kept on that for six weeks and only just now moving to 0.5. Slow gradual is the right way. Too much at once will make you sick."""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""Unbelievable medicine - although I was supposed to start with a 0.25 dose and move up to 0.5, I never did. I have stayed on the 0.25 dose and feel amazing. I have lost 30 lbs, don���������t have any bad taste in my mouth, no bloating or excess gas. Actually, I can���������t find anything bad to say about this medication other than it is expensive. I feel better than I have in years, and my A1C is unbelievable! Keep it up but please make"""
"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""Horrible experience. I only took 2 dosages because I had difficulty functioning with headaches, eye pain, nausea, dizziness, and overall feeling awful. The additional issue is I've been off the drug for a week and can't get rid of the symptoms. I'm nauseous every day, with headaches, and dizziness. How long until all of this goes away?"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I���������ve been on Ozempic for 6 months. I had gestational diabetes with both children so I know I have an increased risk of type 2. I had bloodwork done and unsurprisingly my fasting sugar was high, but my A1C was high normal. My doctor prescribed Ozempic and I am currently at 1mg/week. Results: blood sugar in perfect range, lost 20 pounds (15% body weight), loss of sense of taste for tons of foods, alcohol aversion. All in all, I���������m far healthier but I do miss enjoying food. I wonder if this is sustainable long term. Tim"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I have been on Ozempic for 2.5 weeks now and I have lost 12 pounds. I don���������t eat anything fried or greasy. I watch fat intake because this medicine can make you sick if you have too much fat in what you are eating. It can also make you sick if you overeat. If you eat small to moderate meals with light snacks in between, you will probably not have any problems. If you cannot stay away from fast food and greasy pizza, you will have a problem. I have found that this medicine makes me not as hungry. It takes the edge off. It also keeps me from craving junk. I get full at mealtime, eating less. I drink a lot of water too. I also use an app on my phone to log food, calories, and exercise. I weigh once a week. I hope this helps someone else that is considering this"""
"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""I never had any weight issues until I turned 60. All the weight gain seemed to go right to my stomach. No matter what I did (including exercise and diet), nothing worked to diminish the belly fat. I started taking Ozempic at 0.25mg/week for 4 injections. I lost 15 pounds on that starter dosage. I increased to 0.5mg the following month and lost another 15 pounds. I will begin the 1mg dose this weekend for the next month. The Ozempic seemed to target that subcutaneous belly fat, which is where I had the greatest weight loss. Except for a mild headache after the first dose and subsequent constipation, there were no other side effects. I took something to relieve constipation. My stomach is now almost as flat as a board, and I don���������t look pregnant. I know carrying all that excess subcutaneous fat is very dangerous, and Ozempic melted that fat away. I would recommend keeping yourself very well hydrated and asking your doctor for a prescription to address the constipation. Truly am"""
"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""I have been taking Ozempic since 12/22. I was put on this injectable drug due to obesity, high cholesterol, and borderline high blood pressure plus pre-diabetic. I have lost 30 lbs. so far. I am more than pleased that my cholesterol is now 180 from 270 on medication. I have never been below 200 total cholesterol in my life! I have had no symptoms taking Ozempic except a little indigestion the first month. It is very convenient to use (inject once a week), and the needle is so thin (less than a hair) you don���������t even feel it. I had tried every diet, exercise, and fasting to lose weight and get my cholesterol under control. Ozempic is the only thing that has w"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I have tried them all! I was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 18, and I will be 40 this September. When I say I have tried them all, it���������s no exaggeration, but my search stops here! This medicine has done in a couple of weeks what I have been trying to do all my adult life! My blood sugar is perfect! I actually look forward to testing my sugars throughout the day. The other day, I cheated and had a slice of caramel cheesecake. Normally, this would spike my blood sugars well over 250, but when I tested my sugar one hour after consumption, I was at 132! It only got lower as the night went on! This is some good stuff! I am so happy my doctor recommended this for me! I���������m in love! I���������m finally optimistic about my future with this"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""My husband began taking Ozempic for his Type 2 diabetes several months ago and experienced minimal unpleasant side effects. His food consumption is down approximately 2/3 (no more 'first breakfast and second breakfast' and 'first dinner and second dinner') and he has been able to reduce his diabetes medications. He has been steadily losing excess weight. A bonus is the chronic loose stools he used to suffer have been eliminated. I started taking Ozempic for my Type 2 diabetes 6 weeks ago. My food consumption is down significantly and I've been able to discontinue all other diabetes medications. I've had some slight nausea and a mild bit of constipation, both of which have been easily alleviated through dietary changes (much smaller meals, more fiber and more spicy food). We absolutely love this medication."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I've been using Ozempic for 18 months. A1c has dropped from 8.1 to 6.0. Weight dropped from 195 lbs to 157 lbs. Minor side effects for the first two weeks. I dropped most of the weight within 4 months and my A1c went down to 6.3 in those 4 months. My doctor decided to take me off Ozempic after 6 months to see if I'd stabilized, but within 4 weeks, my A1c was back in the upper 7s. I'm staying on Ozempic for now. Great medication but a ridiculous price."""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""I can���������t hold this back anymore as this medication has changed my life. For years I have been overweight, spent a lot of money buying tabs, shakes, diet plans, personal trainers... you name it. My life was bad, low self-esteem. As a nurse for over 15 years, this was very bad for me. I have been taking Ozempic for 7 months now and have lost 5st. It works like magic. I still have to watch what I eat, drink a lot of water, and try to do minimum exercises. Ozempic changed my"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""My health wasn't good, so I fired the nurse practitioner I was seeing and got an internist doctor. Found out my thyroid was almost non-functional, high blood pressure, and my pre-diabetes rate was on a serious climb. 1 year later, I was at the right dose of Synthroid. Doctor put me on metformin and phentermine, and added Ozempic 2 weeks later at 0.25. That was a rough ride, I was nauseated and dizzy a lot! I started at 265 lbs, and every day I would see a pound or 2 come off. As of this morning, I weighed in at 239, and I'm up to 1 mg dose of Ozempic weekly. I take the anti-nausea now just before my Ozempic dose, and that's it. I use doTERRA ginger. A1C down to 5! I'm glad I listened to my doctor and my pharmacist and stuck with it. Anything worth having doesn't usually come easy! I would like to get down to the 160-170 range, I'm 5'11'', and thinner than that, I start to look like Olive Oyl! OH Popeye!"""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Started April 1, 2021, on Ozempic low dose. 3-week intervals it was increased. Side effects were constipation (went on laxatives to help), pain in my back (severe), bloating. Week 11 increased to 1mg, the side effects were major bloating, diarrhea, sounds in my stomach (crazy), nauseous, feeling under the weather.

I was able to 'live' with it until now. She decided to up my dose to the 1.0 and my body went into total chaos. I am always nauseous, constipated, got reflux, feels like my food is stuck in my stomach and doesn't go anywhere. I'm constantly burping and feeling bloated. The sick feeling feels intensified and I cannot function at work. I took my last one this past Friday night and was miserable all weekend long. Today I am at work unable to function at my best because the nausea is bad. I would say it is effective in lowering your blood sugar numbers and helping you lose weight but not worth feeling horribly sick over. I will not be using this medication any longer."""

I was told to expect some GI upset, but I had no idea it would be this bad. Seven days after taking it, I started with diarrhea. One day after injection number 2 (2.5mg), I was up all night with diarrhea, nausea, severe reflux, belching, and eventually vomiting. Medications like Pepto can't seem to touch it.

Food habits are now also non-existent. I feel fuller for longer. This drug is amazing, and to only inject once weekly is fabulous! I do recommend Ozempic highly.

I started at 254 lbs and started taking 0.25mg for 6 weeks. No side effects in the slightest. I also didn���������t lose much either though because it is your body getting used to the medication rather than fixing your blood sugars. I then moved up to 0.5 and started seeing results with my weight and still no bad side effects other than eating less. I recently moved up to 1mg and am now down a total of 45 pounds in 5 months.

"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""In June of 2019, I was prescribed Ozempic for the first time for weight loss. I was given a sample in the office, and my prescription was sent to the pharmacy. My doctor was super optimistic, and I had seen drastic results in someone else I knew, but had been warned about the nausea. I am insulin resistant, have PCOS, and had gastric sleeve surgery in 2008. At the time I started the first 0.25 dose, I weighed 191.2 lbs. On the single pen, I did 4 weeks of 0.25 and 2 weeks of 0.5 doses. At the end of the 6th week, I weighed 173.8 lbs. That���������s 17.4 lbs in 6 weeks! Of course, then insurance denied covering it moving forward, and I was unable to continue.

"For Diabetes, Type 2""I feel that the best practice for this medicine would be to take about only 8-10 clicks (17 clicks = 0.25) for the first several weeks and then build yourself up to the full 0.25 dose. That way you can see what side effects you are going to experience and if they are tolerable or not. I took 0.25 and suffered from severe diarrhea for almost the full 7 days. Ended up in the hospital for the last 4 days until the side effects wore off. The only positive was that I lost almost 20lbs. I would be very careful taking this medicine."""

However around month 3 the nausea and diarrhea subsided greatly and my appetite returned. I had lost weight very quickly (42 lbs in 3 months due to not really eating much). Had to take supplements for a while but am now eating well. The rapid weight loss led to telogen effluvium, a temporary hair loss condition. (I shed A LOT but never showed any baldness or anything). Currently, my weight is still down (I was taken off my blood pressure medication!), my blood counts are perfect, my hair is getting thick, and I eat normally.

At first, I had a few side effects which included nausea and constipation but they did resolve. I noticed almost immediately how much better I felt on this drug. Not only was my appetite significantly decreased, I felt better overall, sort of like my metabolism was more even and my body utilized what I ate more efficiently. I lost my work insurance in November and also lost the coverage for Ozempic. This is the only downfall. I do have private insurance through HealthPartners but not one cent is covered by them. The price per month is around $800.

"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""I just started Ozempic to help with weight loss. My first injection (0.25) was four days ago. I was nervous at first about injecting myself with anything. The needle doesn't hurt at all. I was also nervous about possible side effects after reading the reviews. I went through with it anyway and have had zero side effects. I'm pretty sure I've been eating less and haven't been as hungry. I think it has been curbing the hunger. I read one review that said to inject in the thigh, not the stomach, even though the instructions say either are fine, as well as the upper arm. My pharmacist recommended the stomach so that's what I did and I was completely fine. Here's hoping for some decent help with weight loss when used with eating better (and less) as well as some exercise. Make sure you refrigerate it.

"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""I was prescribed Ozempic for weight loss in Nov 2022. I started on 0.25 mg for one month. I found it slightly suppressed my appetite, and the side effects I had were awful heartburn, constipation, and sulfur burps. Sometimes I felt nauseous. I decided to stick with it anyway and increased to 0.5 mg after one month. The symptoms were the same but added in fatigue. A month later, I bumped up to 0.75, and the burps, fatigue, and heartburn subsided. I went to 1 mg two months later, and all symptoms disappeared.

"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""Ozempic for weight loss is AMAZING! I have tried everything for weight loss since 1985. Ozempic by far is a miracle for me.

I took 0.25 for the first week and then 0.5 weekly on Sundays. I have stayed with Weight Watchers, mainly selecting 'free foods'. If you are eating out with friends this summer, remember that rich, high-fat content foods will give you immediate abdominal distress (cramps, diarrhea). So, I've learned to go through restaurant menus and find something less distressful to eat so that I can enjoy time with friends and family. I have Zofran for nausea, but for me, the nausea passes and I do not use anything for nausea. Stay active at least walk! It's free!

"For Diabetes, Type 2""Take my comments for what they are worth since I changed many things in my life at the same time, but I think Ozempic is great. After 5 months, it reduced my A1c from 9.7 to 5.9. I lost almost 25 pounds. I am at 0.5mg, and it has drastically reduced my appetite. Between a smaller stomach and this drug, I often push my plate away before finishing, rarely a desire for dessert. Little to no side effects overall. Some stomach issues like constipation and bloating, but I can't rule out dietary changes being the cause as well. I went on a low-carb diet and really stuck to it for once and increased exercise a lot. The use of the Freestyle Libre Sensor really helped too! Being able to learn how things affect your blood sugar in real time is a great motivator to do the right thing, combine carbs with protein, etc. I am hoping to lower other meds I am on when I see my doctor next month. Once a week, a tiny needle (virtually pain-free) is a far better system than taking pills every day."""

After that experience, I have learned never to do that again. I now usually eat a big breakfast and a snack later on throughout the day, which has helped me completely cut out soda. I originally started taking this because I was experiencing rapid weight gain. They checked my thyroid and said it was within normal limits, so they put me on Ozempic, and I am so glad. In the morning, I haven���������t had a blood sugar reading over 130 in a month. I am looking forward to going back to my doctor to figure out my A1C. In total, I���������ve lost 8 poun"""
"For Weight Loss (Obesity/Overweight)""I have been taking Ozempic for six weeks. This will be my second week at 0.50 mg, and I have lost 10 lbs. At 0.25 mg, I had minor nausea and was very tired but felt fine otherwise. After my first 0.50 mg injections, I could not drink, eat, or do anything for the first day. I had a lot of nausea and felt like I was going to be sick constantly. By day 3, I had to go to the bathroom about nine times, which was good because constipation is a real thing with this medication. By day 4 and on, I felt perfectly fine. I do watch what I eat, and the medication has cut my food intake by half. You have to pay attention to what your stomach is telling you."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I have been prescribed Ozempic for weight loss secondary to type 2. I got nauseated with some loss of appetite at 0.25 mg dosage and adapted to it over a month. Lost 9 lbs in that month. I increased to 0.5 mg last Friday (it is Tuesday), and I am miserable. Non-stop nausea, burping, some pain in the stomach, constipated. I feel miserable. I am worried about the stomach pain being pancreatitis starting, so I am increasing my water. I haven't eaten in two days. I will not continue with this drug as I think this just cannot be a good thing to do to one's body."""

Today I weighed 191 lbs., or a loss of 83 lbs. over the duration - or about 30% of my body weight. Some slight dizziness from time to time which has diminished considerably after the 2nd month.

"For Diabetes, Type 2""Started taking Ozempic for pre-diabetes and insulin resistance. This is the first medication I've ever taken for diabetes. A1c was 5.7. I increased the dose quickly at the doctor's recommendation if little to no side effects occurred. First dose 0.25 in the office. Second 0.5 a week later. Third dose at 1.0 a week after that. Only side effect I have is mild nausea. Appetite has disappeared, and I eat only when hungry and much smaller portions. Serious bloating when I eat too much, which is a great deterrent. Been on the medication for 4 weeks overall, 2 weeks at 1.0, weight dropped from 305 lbs. to 295 lbs. Still a little lethargic, but I was very lethargic before starting the medication. I feel like this medicine is a game changer for me. I love not thinking about food all of the time, only eating when hungry and not for pleasure, and losing weight. Will retest A1c in 2 months. Hopefully, the weight loss continues, and I caught the A1c level before it turns into full-blown diabetes."""

"For Diabetes, Type 2""It's the miracle drug. It reduced my A1C from 11.3 to 5.4 so far. I've been taking it for a little over one year, lost some weight, and no side effects whatsoever since the first dosage.

My A1C was 11, and it dropped to 5.6 by changing my diet and taking the Metformin. My doctor wanted me to try Ozempic to help me lose weight and possibly eliminate the Metformin. The side effects were terrible right from the start. Nausea and diarrhea, no vomiting, just nausea. I started at 0.25 and am now up to 1.0. My appetite is gone completely. I have no desire to eat at all. When I do eat, I get full almost immediately. I have gone from 228 lb down to 202 lb in the six weeks I have been taking Ozempic. I'm thrilled with the weight loss, and the nausea and diarrhea have improved. However, I have almost stopped peeing. I go in the morning, then go all day into the evening without going.

"For Diabetes, Type 2""I am male (early 50s). Blood glucose was already regulated with metformin, diet, and exercise (100 to 150), but I wanted to quit metformin because of its side effects (diarrhea). I was put on 0.50 mg/wk and warned that nausea from Ozempic was a common side effect. I had no idea! Week 1/Week 2: I couldn't smell food without getting queasy. I choked down lots of soup just to get 1200 cal/day (often falling short). Week 3/Week 4 got slightly better. Week 5: I have my appetite back. I feel full, so I eat smaller meals. My weight loss is atypical: 203 lbs to 183 lbs in five weeks, combined with exercise (1 hr/4x wk stationary bike/treadmill). Blood glucose is now between 90 and 120, with occasional dips and peaks. I would only recommend this drug to those who have very high glucose levels, are morbidly obese, fiercely stubborn, and/or desperate. But it works. Good luck."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""Well, let me start by saying Ozempic worked very well for me. I was on it for a little over 4 months. I lost 49 pounds, my A1C went from over 9 to 6.7, I'm off insulin now. Then we went to a higher deductible insurance plan and I can no longer afford my Ozempic. The only thing they offer is the $150 savings card, so it still costs over $600 a month. I can have a roof over my head or get my meds. What a world we live in. I guess I should quit my job, then I could get some assistance with it."""
"For Cardiovascular Risk Reduction""I've been on Ozempic for two and a half months now for weight loss, and the results have been great. I've lost about 25 lbs. The only thing I don't really like is I truly do have no appetite. At all. So sometimes eating is a slog. Just getting through 3 or 4 bites of a meal can be annoying. And even though it's been almost 3 months, I still get nausea from time to time. I also had to dial back a lot of my social drinking, as I'm eating so little, there's nothing to absorb the alcohol in my stomach most days, causing indigestion, acid reflux, vomiting, and other problems. Still, I'm going to stick with the medication to see how much weight I can potentially lose over the course of six months."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I've been taking Ozempic for about 2 months to lower my Diabetes 2. It's been great, my numbers were 200 to 300, they are now 100-134.

My only side effect has been an occasional headache, but nausea was brutal. I was getting very nauseated after eating and taking Synjardy XR until I heard about ZOFRAN. Let me just say, if you have nausea and are taking Metformin with Ozempic, PLEASE ask your doctor for a prescription of ZOFRAN (I got the generic ONDANSETRON 4mg). I take it 20 minutes after I eat and have taken my metformin. I NO LONGER get nausea. Zofran will definitely help with nausea if you're feeling sick. You'll thank me later."""

"For Diabetes, Type 2""This Ozempic was prescribed as a last-ditch effort to get my A1C down prior to starting insulin. The first 0.25 dose caused significant nausea, but I battled through it for a couple of weeks before starting the 0.50 dose. The nausea increased with the higher dose, and I considered stopping but had lost ten pounds, had zero appetite, and my sugar was down, so I chose to continue. It's been about 6 months now, I'm taking the full 1.0 dose, and although the nausea is still an issue, it has lessened in severity and comes in 'waves,' so I know it will pass and just tough it through. I've dropped about 30 lbs and counting, my A1C is now in the prediabetic range, and I've been able to lower doses of other medications that were causing significant side effects. I now feel better, look better, have more energy, and no longer have the constant food cravings or desire to overeat. If you can ride out the nausea, the benefits of Ozempic are huge, for me anyway."""

"For Diabetes, Type 2""The first few weeks I suffered some nausea, and my food intake was reduced probably about 30% as a result. I started at 0.25 for a month, then 0.50 for a month, then 1.00, which was the full dose. I have been on the drug for about 6 months now. My weight dropped 30 pounds from 264 pounds to 234 pounds, and I seem to be leveling at that range. My target BMI weight for 6 feet 3 inches is 210, but I would be happy at 225. I have found that Ozempic did cause some constipation, but overall, once I achieved the full dose for a few weeks, I felt much better. The weight loss has really helped how I feel, and I will be doing my 6-month blood workup next week. Hoping to see some good results with glucose, which was at 6.0, and cholesterol at 259. Overall, I am very happy with the results to date."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I've been taking Ozempic for two weeks now. I wondered how this drug could allow some - or most - people to lose weight. Now I know - it makes you feel sort of sick to your stomach and takes away your appetite - at least that is my result so far. I am hoping to develop a tolerance to it. Not a really pleasant experience so far, but I have not vomited or had diarrhea as some users have reported. It does appear to be lowering my blood glucose somewhat, which is the primary reason I am taking it. I am also taking metformin but have been able to reduce the dosage. I am still only taking 0.25 mg of Ozempic, so the result of higher dosages is unknown now. I will post again in a month or two with higher dosage usage results."""

I started with a dose of 0.25 for the first four weeks and have been on 0.5 for the remaining six. On the 0.25 dose, I felt my appetite was slightly reduced, and I had some mild nausea. As soon as I went to 0.5, the side effects started, and I began getting extreme nausea, diarrhea, rancid burps, and I can no longer eat. If I eat more than a regular ham and cheese sandwich in a day, I feel extremely nauseous and the burps come back. As of my last doctor's appointment, I've lost about 3 pounds, but I don't know if I can keep this up. I'm miserable. I won't know until next month whether it's working like my doctor has intended because she needs blood tests to verify all of that, so I can't speak to how effective it has been yet."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I was moved to Ozempic from Januvia. At the time I started Ozempic, I'd brought my blood sugar down to what would translate to an A1C of 5.5 or so, and I'd managed to kick most of the insulin I was on. I started Ozempic at 0.25 units per week and had mild nausea and diarrhea, but my appetite vanished and I could barely bring myself to eat. Once I started the full dose, my blood sugars began to climb rapidly. I'd be fine in the mornings at first and then experience wild spikes between meals, until finally, my fasting sugar started to climb out of my desired range. I actually had to take MORE insulin, not less, just to keep my fasting BG below 7. Ozempic was absolutely NOT worth it - even with the lower price here in Canada, the cost is ridiculous, the benefits never materialized, and the effects on my appetite destroyed the healthy diet I was trying to eat. Good example of how new isn't always good."""
"For Diabetes, Type 2""I have been on Ozempic (semaglutide) for 7 weeks and am presently on 0.5mg dose. Positives - I have lost 15 pounds, my A1c has dropped from 6.8 to 6.0. I feel great. Negatives - Blood level dropped fast with the first shot, after that no issues, slight nausea right after the shot. It doesn't last more than 30 mins. Positives outweigh the negatives IMO."""
